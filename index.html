<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 30px">Hello! I'm Monal Narasimhamurthy, a first year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm working with the <a href="http://plv.colorado.edu">Programming Languages and Verification group at CU Boulder(CUPLV)</a>. I'm currently being advised by <a href="http://www.matthewhammer.org">Prof. Matthew Hammer</a>. We are working on incrementalizing useful algorithms using <a href="http://plv.colorado.edu/adapton/">Adapton</a>.

<li><a href="https://github.com/cuplv/incremental-flashfill">Incremental FlashFill [In Progress]</a></li>
FlashFill is a Microsoft Excel 2013 feature that fills out columns of the spreadsheet automatically when a pattern is visible based on a few examples provided by the user. The work is explained in 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sumitg/pubs/popl11-synthesis.pdf">Automating String Processing in Spreadsheets using Input-Output Examples, POPL 2011, Sumit Gulwani</a>. We are working on incrementalizing the intersection of Directed Acyclic Graphs, the data structure used to represent string expressions.
<li><a href="">Predicting and Mapping the Northern Lights</a></li>
Northern Lights (also known as Aurora Borealis) are natural electromagnetic phenomena characterized by
the appearance of colored lights in the night sky, usually near the higher latitudes. This paper explores
machine learning techniques to predict the Northern Lights. Northern Lights are created when charged
solar particles hit the upper layers of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. This geomagnetic activity is calculated
in terms of two indices - 24 hour A index, 3-hourly K indices. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) maintains a daily record of the estimated planetary A indices and K indices
obtained from a network of magnetometers spread across the western hemisphere. Using a historical
dataset of recorded indices between the years 1997 and 2015, a supervised machine learning model is
trained to predict the intensity of auroral activity on a given day.
