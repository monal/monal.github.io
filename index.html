<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 30px">Hello! I'm Monal Narasimhamurthy, a first year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm working with the <a href="http://plv.colorado.edu">Programming Languages and Verification group at CU Boulder(CUPLV)</a>. I'm currently being advised by <a href="http://www.matthewhammer.org">Prof. Matthew Hammer</a>. We are working on incrementalizing useful algorithms using <a href="http://plv.colorado.edu/adapton/">Adapton</a>.

<li><a href="https://github.com/cuplv/incremental-flashfill">Incremental FlashFill [In Progress]</a></li>
FlashFill is a Microsoft Excel 2013 feature that fills out columns of the spreadsheet automatically when a pattern is visible based on a few examples provided by the user. The work is explained in 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sumitg/pubs/popl11-synthesis.pdf">Automating String Processing in Spreadsheets using Input-Output Examples, POPL 2011, Sumit Gulwani</a>. We are working on incrementalizing the intersection of Directed Acyclic Graphs, the data structure used to represent string expressions.
<li><a href="">Predicting and Mapping the Northern Lights</a></li>
Northern Lights (also known as Aurora Borealis) are natural electromagnetic phenomena characterized by
the appearance of colored lights in the night sky, usually near the higher latitudes. 
Using a historical dataset obtained from a network of magnetometers spread across the western hemisphere between the years 1997 and 2015, a supervised machine learning model is
trained to predict the intensity of auroral activity on a given day.
